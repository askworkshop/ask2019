Welcome to the home page of the **9th Asian Workshop on Symmetric Key Cryptography**. This workshop will be held on three days at *University of Hyogo*, Kobe Campus for Information Science, Japan, starting on **December 13th until December 15th, 2019**.

ASK has been held to promote research on symmetric-key cryptography in Asia since 2011. Broadly, the scope of the workshop includes, but is not limited to:

- Primitive design: block ciphers, stream ciphers, hash functions, (cryptographic) permutations etc.
- Design and analysis of mode of operation: (authenticated) encryption schemes, message authentication codes etc.
- Cryptanalysis and evaluation tools.
- (Post)-Quantum symmetric-key schemes.
- Symmetric-key searchable encryption schemes.
- Secure implementation of symmetric-key schemes.

The program will contain mainly two parts: **invited talks** in the mornings, and **group discussions** in the afternoons. For group discussions, we plan to have several small groups, and for each group, we aim to gather researchers who are all interested in one specific topic. The goal of the group discussion is to advance the collaborations within the research community, and to find new results through discussions.
